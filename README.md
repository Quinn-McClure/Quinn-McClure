# Welcome to my GitHub!

Hello, my name is Quinn McClure. I am a Computer Science major and an Environmental Studies minor at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse. I hope to combine the disciplines of my major and minor in my future career to help with the evolving climate crisis. After graduation I hope to pursue a career in full stack web and mobile development.
